          "description": "**Warhammer Kill Team** is a **skirmish wargame** that allows players to control small, specialized squads. The game is set in the **Warhammer 40,000** universe and focuses on the tactical management of individual units rather than large-scale battles. It uses an **alternating activation** system, meaning players take turns performing actions, constantly reacting to their opponent's moves.\n\n---\n\n# General Overview\n\n## **Complexity**\n- Kill Team is a **deep and complex strategy game** that requires tactical planning, positioning, and dice rolling.\n- The mechanics are intricate but easy to grasp if you're familiar with the basics of Warhammer 40,000.\n\n## **Game Duration**\n- A typical game lasts **1-2 hours**, depending on how well you know the rules and your team.\n\n## **Your Kill Team**\n- Your squad consists of **6-14 miniatures**, selected from **fixed faction rosters**.\n- Almost every **Warhammer 40,000 faction** is available in Kill Team, with some exceptions (*Custodes, Tyranid Hive Fleet, Grey Knights, Deathwatch, Chaos Daemons*).\n- Your team generally consists of:\n  - **1 Leader**: The most valuable and powerful model in your squad.\n  - **Specialists**: Models with unique abilities that provide tactical advantages.\n  - **Warriors**: Standard operatives that fill the remaining slots in your squad.\n- **6-model teams** usually consist of elite units (e.g., **Space Marines, Chaos Legions**), while **10-14 model teams** are more horde-based (e.g., **Orks, Imperial Guard**).\n\n---\n\n# Objective of the Game\n\nThe goal of the game is to score more **Victory Points (VP)** than your opponent over the course of **four rounds**. You can earn points through three main sources:\n\n### 1. **Crit Op (Primary Objective)**\n   - **Crit Op** points are earned by capturing, activating, and holding **objective markers**.\n   - Both players score from the same objectives, making strategic positioning and timing crucial.\n\n### 2. **Kill Op (Eliminating Enemy Operatives)**\n   - Earn points by eliminating enemy operatives.\n   - This encourages an aggressive playstyle, though it may not always be the most effective strategy.\n\n### 3. **Tac Op (Tactical Objectives)**\n   - **Tac Op** points are earned by completing secret objectives based on your team’s **archetype**.\n   - Archetypes include **Infiltration, Recon, Security, Seek & Destroy**.\n   - These objectives typically involve tactical challenges such as infiltrating enemy territory, gathering intelligence, or securing specific locations.\n\n---\n\n# What You Need to Play\n\n## **Essential Equipment**\n- **1 team** of miniatures (6-14 models).\n- **Set of six-sided dice (D6)**.\n- **Markers and tokens** (for tracking wounds, conditions, etc.).\n- **Measuring tools** (inch-based rulers or tape measures).\n- **Optional but useful items**:\n  - Laser pointer.\n  - Notebook or digital tool for tracking game progress.\n  - Rulebook, team data cards, mission and equipment cards.\n\n## **Game Board**\n- **Board size**: **22x30 inches** (approx. 56x76 cm).\n- **Terrain**: Kill Team uses much more terrain than larger-scale wargames. Recommended setup includes:\n  - **2-4 large buildings or ruins**.\n  - **2-4 smaller terrain pieces** (e.g., crumbling walls, pipes, containers).\n  - **Scattered minor elements** (e.g., barricades, barrels, crates)."

          "description": "\n### **1. Set up the Battle**\n\n-   Each player selects a **Kill Team**.\n-   Determine the **killzone** and set up terrain features. Ensure terrain types are specified.\n-   Set up **objective markers**, which, except in **Killzone: Bheta-Decima**, must be placed on the killzone floor.\n-   **Roll-off** – the winner decides who has initiative.\n\n### **2. Select Operatives**\n\n-   Each player secretly selects their **operatives**, adhering to the selection requirements in their kill team’s rules.\n-   Each player secretly selects up to **four equipment options** (each option can only be selected once per player). Selections are then revealed simultaneously.\n-   Each player gains **2 Command Points (CP)**.\n-   Each player secretly selects a **tac op** from one of their kill team’s archetypes (**Infiltration, Recon, Security, Seek & Destroy**).\n\n### **3. Set Up Operatives**\n\n-   Players take turns setting up **pre-battle equipment** (e.g., ladders), starting with the player with initiative. _(This is done item by item, not option by option.)_\n-   Players take turns setting up **one-third of their kill team** (rounding up), starting with the player with initiative.\n-   Operatives must be placed **wholly within their drop zone** and assigned a **Conceal order**.\n\n### **4. Scouting**\n\nThe **Scouting** phase not only provides pre-game advantages but also determines who has **initiative** in the first turning point using a **rock-paper-scissors** mechanic.\n\n#### **Scouting Options**\n\n1\uFE0F⃣ **Equip**\n\n-   Select one additional **equipment option** (it cannot be one you’ve already chosen).\n-   **Beats**: **Ploy**\n\n2\uFE0F⃣ **Ploy**\n\n-   In the first **Strategy phase**, you may use a **Strategy Ploy** for **0 CP**.\n-   **Beats**: **Reposition**\n\n3\uFE0F⃣ **Reposition**\n\n-   Perform a **free Reposition action** with one friendly operative wholly within your **drop zone** (it must remain within **3”** of the drop zone).\n-   **Beats**: **Equip**\n\n#### **Rock-Paper-Scissors Mechanic**\n\n-   **Equip** beats **Ploy**\n-   **Ploy** beats **Reposition**\n-   **Reposition** beats **Equip**\n-   **If tied**: The player who **did not** have initiative during setup decides.\n\n### **5. Play the Battle**\n\n-   The battle consists of **4 Turning Points**.\n-   Players alternate activating their operatives to perform actions.\n-   At the start of the first **Turning Point**, each player secretly selects their **primary op** (**Crit Op, Kill Op, or Tac Op**), which will grant additional victory points (**VP**) at the end of the battle.\n\n### **6. End the Battle**\n\n-   The battle ends after the **4th Turning Point**.\n-   If one player has no **operatives in the killzone**, the opponent continues playing out each remaining turn until the battle ends.\n-   Players reveal their **primary op** and score additional **VP** (equal to half of what they earned from it, rounding up).\n-   The player with the most **VP** wins. In case of a tie, the battle is a **draw**"
